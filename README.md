# OOP-Basic-Part-1
This C++ project demonstrates core OOP concepts—classes, objects, encapsulation, and getter/setter methods—through practical examples: Person, Student, BankAccount, Employee, and Vehicle classes with user input and data management.
# OOP Lab Task 1 – C++ Fundamentals

This repository implements foundational Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++, aligned with **CS112 Lab Task #1** from Air University.

## Features
- Classes with **private attributes** and **public getter/setter methods**
- Encapsulation and data validation
- Multiple object creation
- Practical examples:
  - `Person` (name)
  - `Student` (name, age)
  - `BankAccount` (account number, balance + deposit)
  - `Employee` (name, salary)
  - `Vehicle` (name, model, speed, price)

## How to Run
1. Compile with a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ main.cpp -o main`)
2. Execute the program and follow on-screen prompts
